Hi my name is Eric!

I'm a Robotics PhD candidate in the <a href="http://mlab.ri.cmu.edu/">
Manipulation Lab </a> at Carnegie Mellon University. I like to tackle research
problems from alternative angles and push ideas to their computational limits.
My research is focused on developing novel techniques using the mathematics
behind robotic manipulation and applying these techniques to control and
planning for robotic manipulation.

I'm currently residing in Pittsburgh. I have a cat named Krispy who pets my head
in the morning (its endearing but clawy). In my spare time, I dance salsa and
play tennis.
